For our project, we are planning to use the MEAN stack. We are currently already using Node and Express for the back-end portion of the code, calling the chosen API. Among other options, we were considering Python and Django, however, the MEAN stack seems more "user friendly", especially for someone who does not have much experience in Web Development. It is very convenient to be able to use Java Script both on back-end and front-end and it has an easy to access and use documentation provided.
